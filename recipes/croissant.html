    <p>Making croissants can be a delightful endeavor, though it requires patience and precision. Below, you'll discover a comprehensive list of ingredients and detailed instructions to guide you through the process:</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>⅔ cup unsalted butter, chilled</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine warm water, yeast, and 1 teaspoon sugar in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Measure flour into a mixing bowl. Combine warm milk, 2 teaspoons sugar, and salt in a separate bowl; blend milk mixture, yeast mixture, and oil into flour. Mix well and knead until smooth. Cover, and let rise until over tripled in volume, about 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Deflate gently, and let rise again until doubled, about another 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Deflate dough and chill for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Massage butter until pliable, but not soft and oily. Pat dough into a 14x8-inch rectangle.</li>
        <li>Smear butter over top two-thirds, leaving a 1/4-inch margin all around. Fold unbuttered third over middle third, and buttered top third down over that.</li>
        <li>Turn 90 degrees, so that folds are to left and right. Roll out to a 14x6-inch rectangle. Fold in three again. Sprinkle lightly with flour, and put dough in a resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Unwrap, sprinkle with flour, and deflate gently. Roll to a 14x6-inch rectangle, and fold again. Turn 90 degrees, and repeat. Wrap and chill 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To shape, roll dough out to a 20x5-inch rectangle. Cut in half crosswise, and chill half while shaping the other half. Roll out to a 15x5-inch rectangle. Cut into three 5x5-inch squares. Cut each square in half diagonally.</li>
        <li>Roll each triangle lightly to elongate the point, and make it 7 inches long. Grab the other 2 points, and stretch them out slightly as you roll it up.</li>
        <li>Place on a baking sheet, curving slightly. Let shaped croissants rise until puffy and light.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat together egg and 1 tablespoon water. Glaze croissants with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crisp, flaky, and golden brown, about 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
